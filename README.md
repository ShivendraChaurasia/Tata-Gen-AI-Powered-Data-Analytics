Task 1: EDA using GenAI
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the foundational step in understanding a dataset before developing predictive models. It helps uncover patterns, inconsistencies, and missing values to ensure data quality and reliability.

Why EDA Matters in Predicting Delinquency:
Ensures data integrity: Identifies missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Highlights patterns and anomalies: Helps detect trends in customer behavior.

Prevents biased models: Reduces the risk of unfair treatment by ensuring diverse data representation.

Supports better decision-making: Provides clear insights for proactive customer engagement.

Key Steps in Conducting EDA
Understanding the dataset: Identifying key variables, data types, and missing values.

Identifying missing values and outliers: Deciding whether to remove or impute missing data.

Understanding relationships between variables: Exploring correlations, such as between credit utilization and delinquency risk.

Detecting patterns and risk factors: Identifying behaviors associated with delinquency.

Data Analysis Findings Report
The initial analysis produced the following key findings:

Notable Missing or Inconsistent Data
Missing Values:

Income: 7.8% missing (39 of 500 records).

Loan_Balance: 5.8% missing (29 of 500 records).

Credit_Score: 0.4% missing (2 of 500 records).

Inconsistent Data:

Employment_Status: This categorical feature had inconsistent entries (e.g., 'Employed', 'employed', 'EMP') that required standardization.

Key Anomalies
Credit_Utilization: Some records showed utilization slightly above 1.0, which may be data entry errors or extreme cases.

Skewed Distributions: Income, Credit_Utilization, and Loan_Balance were all right-skewed.

Delinquent_Account Imbalance: The target variable is severely imbalanced, with only 16% of accounts being delinquent. This requires special handling (e.g., oversampling, undersampling) to prevent model bias.

Early Indicators of Delinquency Risk:

Missed_Payments: This feature directly quantifies past payment behavior and is a strong early indicator. Higher values of missed payments are likely to correlate with increased delinquency risk.

Credit_Utilization: High credit utilization rates (closer to 1.0) generally indicate financial strain and are often strong predictors of future delinquency.

Credit_Score: Lower credit scores are typically associated with higher credit risk and thus serve as a key indicator of potential delinquency.

Debt_to_Income_Ratio: A higher debt-to-income ratio suggests a greater financial burden relative to income, which can be an early warning sign of difficulty in managing finances and potential delinquency.

Payment status trend from Month_1 to Month_6: The sequence of payment statuses ('On-time', 'Late', 'Missed') across these six months provides a temporal pattern of payment behavior. A trend of increasing 'Late' or 'Missed' payments over these months would be a strong early indicator of escalating delinquency risk.


Initial Data Quality Observations Summary

The initial assessment of the dataset reveals generally good data quality, with most features being complete and within expected ranges. However, the presence of missing values in Income and Loan_Balance requires careful handling, and the inconsistent capitalization in Employment_Status necessitates data cleaning. The most significant data quality challenge for modeling delinquency is the substantial class imbalance in the Delinquent_Account target variable, which must be addressed to build an effective predictive model. Overall, the dataset provides a solid foundation for building a delinquency prediction model, provided these identified issues are appropriately managed.

Address Missing Data and Data Quality Issues
The following prompts were used to determine the best approach for handling missing data:

“Suggest an imputation strategy for missing values in this dataset based on industry best practices.”

“Propose best-practice methods to handle missing credit utilization data for predictive modeling.”

Recommended Imputation Strategies:
For Credit_Score (0.4% missing): Median imputation is sufficient due to the low percentage of missing data.

For Income (7.8% missing) and Loan_Balance (5.8% missing):

Regression Imputation: Predicts missing values based on other features.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: Fills values based on the k most similar data points.

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE): Considered the gold standard, this method creates multiple imputed datasets to account for uncertainty.

For a balance of effectiveness and simplicity, KNN Imputation or Regression Imputation are good starting points. For maximum statistical rigor, MICE is recommended.

Python Implementation

The data cleaning and imputation steps were implemented in a Python notebook.

Detect Patterns and Risk Factors
The analysis identified several high-risk indicators for delinquency.

High-Risk Indicators for Delinquency
Missed_Payments: A higher number of missed payments directly increases delinquency risk.

Credit_Utilization: High utilization suggests financial strain and a greater likelihood of default.

Credit_Score: A lower score reflects a history of poor credit management.

Debt_to_Income_Ratio: A higher ratio indicates a greater financial burden relative to income.

"Late" or "Missed" Payment Status (Month_1 to Month_6): A trend of deteriorating payment behavior is a strong precursor to delinquency.

Insights Impacting Delinquency Prediction
The significant class imbalance in the target variable must be addressed to build an accurate model.

Skewed numerical distributions may require transformation (e.g., log transformation) for certain models.

The time-series potential of the Month_x variables can be leveraged by creating new features (e.g., number of late payments in the last 3 months).

Derive new features from Month_1 to Month_6 (e.g., payment trends, total late payments).

Encode categorical variables like Credit_Card_Type and Location using one-hot encoding.

Model Selection and Training: Explore various classification models and evaluate them using appropriate metrics for imbalanced datasets (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).

Model Evaluation: Rigorously test the final model on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well.


TASK -2

Predictive Modeling using GenAI - Complete Implementation

Geldium wants to use AI to predict which customers are at risk of missing payments so they can take proactive steps to reduce delinquency. Our goal is to develop a model that supports the Collections team in prioritizing outreach and intervention strategies.

Use GenAI tools to develop a predictive model for identifying high-risk customers.
Choose and justify the best approach—whether decision trees, logistic regression, or another technique.
Define a plan to evaluate model performance while ensuring fairness and explainability.
Geldium will rely on this model to enhance risk assessment and guide intervention decisions. Your structured approach will help determine how accurate and reliable the AI-driven predictions will be.

What is predictive modeling?
Predictive modeling is the process of using historical data to forecast future outcomes. In the context of financial services, it helps institutions like Geldium identify customers who are at risk of delinquency so they can take proactive measures. Traditional predictive modeling typically requires coding expertise, but GenAI tools can assist analysts in building, testing, and refining models with less manual coding.

Instead of manually programming statistical models, GenAI can:

Suggest appropriate modeling techniques based on dataset characteristics.
Draft a description of model logic, or even sample code.
Assist in interpreting results and refining model performance.
By leveraging no-code AI solutions, analysts and business professionals can conceptualize predictive models without needing to be machine learning experts. However, while these tools simplify the modeling process, the outputs they generate must still be validated and refined by experienced analysts to ensure accuracy and reliability in decision-making.

How GenAI assists in predictive modeling
GenAI simplifies the predictive modeling process by guiding users through key steps.

1. Selecting the right model type
Predictive modeling involves choosing the best algorithm for the task. GenAI can analyze dataset characteristics and recommend the most suitable techniques. However, understanding these models yourself is key to making an informed decision.

Three core modeling approaches:
Decision trees – Good for explaining why a prediction was made.
Logistic regression – Useful for predicting binary outcomes (e.g., delinquent vs. non-delinquent).
Neural networks – Effective for complex patterns but harder to interpret.

We will explore these models further in the next section to help you select the right approach for this task.

GenAI prompt:
"Based on this dataset, which predictive modeling techniques are best suited for identifying customers likely to miss payments? Explain why."

2. Generating model code without coding
With the right prompts, GenAI can generate an initial modeling workflow in Python, R, or SQL. However, these outputs should be viewed as a starting point—manual review and refinement are essential to ensure alignment with best practices..

GenAI prompt:
"Generate a logistic regression model framework using this dataset to predict customer delinquency. Provide an explanation of each step, ensuring outputs are reviewed and refined for accuracy and fairness."

3. Evaluating model performance
Once a model is built, its accuracy must be assessed. GenAI can:

Suggest evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
Interpret results and suggest improvements.
Highlight ethical concerns, such as potential biases.
GenAI prompt:
"Evaluate the performance of this predictive model using precision and recall. Identify any biases in the predictions."

By using GenAI-powered modeling, analysts can efficiently build and refine predictive models without needing a technical background, making AI-powered decision-making more accessible in financial services.

Common Techniques for Credit Risk Modeling
Now that you understand how GenAI assists in predictive modeling, let's expand further on three commonly used techniques for credit risk assessment. Each has strengths and trade-offs, and your task will involve choosing the most suitable model for predicting delinquency risk.

1. Decision trees – easy to interpret, great for risk assessment
Decision trees split data into branches based on key features (e.g., income level, number of missed payments). At each step, the model asks a yes or no question, guiding decisions down different paths.

Why use it for credit risk?

Transparency – Easy to explain to stakeholders.
Handles different types of data well – Works with both numerical and categorical data.
Identifies key risk factors – Shows which customer attributes are most predictive of delinquency.
GenAI prompt:
"Generate a decision tree model to predict delinquency risk based on income, credit utilization, and missed payments. Explain how the model determines risk categories."

2. Logistic regression – simple, reliable, and great for probability estimation
Logistic regression predicts the probability of an event occurring, such as whether a customer will or won’t become delinquent. It assigns a probability score (0 to 1), where a threshold (e.g., 0.5) determines classification.

Why use it for credit risk?

Great for binary predictions (e.g., delinquent vs. non-delinquent).
Easy to interpret – Shows the impact of each variable on the outcome.
Works well with structured data – Suitable for datasets with clear numerical patterns.
GenAI prompt:
"Explain how logistic regression can be used to predict credit card delinquency. Generate a simple model using income, debt-to-income ratio, and payment history."

3. Neural networks – powerful for complex patterns but harder to interpret
Neural networks mimic the way human brains process information. They detect complex relationships between variables, making them highly effective for large datasets. However, they operate like a "black box," meaning their decision-making process is less transparent.

Why use it for credit risk?

Can uncover deep patterns in customer financial behavior.
More accurate on large datasets than simpler models.
Useful for predicting long-term credit risk trends.
GenAI prompt:
"Create a basic neural network model for predicting delinquency risk. Compare its strengths and weaknesses against decision trees and logistic regression."

Which model should you choose?
Each model has strengths and trade-offs. In this task, your goal is to choose the best approach based on Geldium’s dataset and business needs.

✅ Use decision trees if you need transparency and clear risk segmentation.
✅ Use logistic regression if you need a probability-based approach that is easy to interpret.
✅ Use neural networks if you have a complex dataset and need high accuracy at the cost of explainability.

Bias, explainability, and fairness in credit risk modeling
AI-driven credit risk models must be accurate, explainable, and fair to ensure responsible financial decision-making. Even well-performing models can introduce bias, produce uninterpretable decisions, or unintentionally disadvantage certain customer groups. Addressing these risks is essential for ethical and legal compliance in financial services.

Bias
Bias occurs when a model systematically favors or disadvantages certain groups, often due to historical inequalities or imbalanced data.

Common causes of bias:

Historical bias – If past lending decisions were unfair, the model may replicate those patterns.
Selection bias – If the dataset does not represent all customer demographics equally, predictions may be inaccurate for some groups.
Proxy bias – Certain variables (e.g., ZIP code) may unintentionally act as proxies for protected characteristics like race or gender.
GenAI prompt:
“Check for bias in this credit risk model. Are certain customer groups unfairly predicted as high risk?”

*While GenAI can assist in identifying potential bias patterns, it should not be relied upon as an authoritative tool for bias detection. GenAI itself can embed biases from its training data and may produce misleading results. Best practice is to use formal statistical fairness metrics (e.g., disparate impact analysis, demographic parity) alongside human oversight.

Explainability
Explainability ensures that decision-makers can understand and justify a model’s predictions.

Decision trees and logistic regression are more interpretable and show clear decision paths.
Neural networks are highly complex and function as "black boxes," making explainability difficult.
Analysts use tools like SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to break down how different factors contribute to predictions.
GenAI prompt:
"Explain why this model predicted high delinquency risk for a specific customer."

*While GenAI is great for assisting in summarizing explanations, relying solely on it for explainability presents significant risks—it may "hallucinate" or generate inaccurate justifications that do not reflect the true model logic. Best practice is to use established interpretability frameworks to ensure transparency and accuracy.

Fairness
A fair model should:

Avoid systematic disadvantages for certain demographic groups.
Be tested for disparate impact to ensure fairness.
Use diverse and representative training data to prevent reinforcing biases.
GenAI prompt:
"Assess fairness in this model’s predictions. Does it disproportionately flag certain customer demographics as high risk?"

*GenAI should not be solely relied upon to assess fairness, as it does not inherently understand regulatory compliance or ethical considerations in financial decision-making. Responsible AI development requires the application of fairness testing frameworks (e.g., equalized odds, demographic parity) and human judgment.

By applying these principles, analysts can ensure that AI-powered risk assessments are transparent, responsible, and unbiased in financial decision-making. However, achieving truly responsible and unbiased financial decision-making also requires human oversight, regulatory compliance, and formal fairness audits that go beyond what GenAI alone can ensure.

Now, Let’s Start the predictive modelling

Step 1: Generate model logic using GenAI
The type of model you would use (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks).
Key input features and how they contribute to predictions.
The general workflow of how the model would process the data to generate outputs.
Prompts to try:

Outline a predictive modeling pipeline to forecast credit delinquency, from feature selection to model evaluation.
Suggest 2 modeling options (simple and complex) for predicting delinquency, and recommend one.
Explain how the delinquency risk model transforms customer input variables into a final risk prediction, from data ingestion to prediction output.
Generate sample code or clear pseudocode for building a credit risk prediction model, using relevant features like income, credit utilization, and missed payments.
GenAI Output,

Here are two modeling options (simple and complex) for predicting delinquency, along with a recommendation:

Modeling Options for Delinquency Prediction
Simple Model Option: Logistic Regression

Description: Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification. It estimates the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class (in this case, being delinquent) by fitting the data to a logistic function.
Pros: It's highly interpretable, computationally efficient, and provides probabilities, which can be useful for risk scoring. It serves as a good baseline model.
Cons: It assumes a linear relationship between independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable. It may not capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data as effectively as more advanced models.
Complex Model Option: Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., LightGBM or XGBoost)

Description: Gradient Boosting Machines are powerful ensemble learning methods that build a strong predictive model by combining multiple weak prediction models (typically decision trees) in a sequential manner. Each new tree corrects the errors made by previous ones.
Pros: They are known for high predictive accuracy, robustness to various data types, and ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and interactions between features. They often perform very well on structured datasets. They also have built-in mechanisms to handle missing values and can provide feature importance.
Cons: These models can be less interpretable ("black-box" models) compared to logistic regression. They can also be more computationally intensive and require careful tuning of hyperparameters to avoid overfitting.
Recommendation
For predicting delinquency in this dataset, I recommend starting with a Gradient Boosting Machine (specifically LightGBM or XGBoost).

Justification: While Logistic Regression is a good starting point, the complex nature of financial behavior, the potential for non-linear relationships among features (like Credit_Score, Income, Credit_Utilization, and Missed_Payments), and the goal of accurately identifying high-risk individuals often warrant a more powerful model. Gradient Boosting Machines are well-suited for this task due to their:

High Predictive Power: They typically achieve superior accuracy compared to simpler models, which is critical for a task like delinquency prediction where misclassifications can have significant consequences.
Robustness to Data Characteristics: They can handle mixed data types and are less sensitive to feature scaling and outliers once hyperparameters are tuned.
Ability to Handle Imbalanced Data: While class imbalance is a challenge for any model, Gradient Boosting frameworks often provide parameters (e.g., scale_pos_weight in XGBoost/LightGBM) or can be combined with sampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE) to effectively manage imbalanced datasets like ours.
It's advisable to establish a strong baseline with a simpler model like Logistic Regression first, but for achieving optimal predictive performance, Gradient Boosting Machines are generally a more robust choice.

ACTION - Summarization,

The recommended model for predicting delinquency is a Gradient Boosting Machine (e.g., LightGBM or XGBoost). This model excels at combining multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, to build a powerful predictive model that can capture complex, non-linear relationships within the data, often resulting in high accuracy. It is also robust to various data types and can effectively handle challenges like class imbalance with appropriate configuration.

Based on their direct relevance to financial behavior and identified patterns, the top 5 input features for predicting delinquency are:

Missed_Payments: Directly indicates past payment issues.
Credit_Utilization: Shows how much of available credit is being used, a sign of financial strain.
Credit_Score: A fundamental measure of an individual's creditworthiness.
Debt_to_Income_Ratio: Reflects the proportion of income dedicated to debt payments, indicating financial burden.
Loan_Balance: The outstanding amount of debt, representing the scale of financial obligation.
Step 2: Justify your model choice
Once you've outlined your model, it’s important to explain why you chose it. Use what you’ve learned about model interpretability, accuracy, and use cases in financial services.

Justify why the selected model is appropriate for predicting delinquency.
Discuss strengths, trade-offs, and why the model fits Geldium’s needs.
Consider interpretability, ease of deployment, and handling of financial data.
Connect your reasoning to real-world business needs (e.g., regulatory compliance, transparency).
Prompts to try:

Explain the pros and cons of using logistic regression vs. decision trees for financial risk prediction.
Compare model options for predicting delinquency and explain how they balance performance and explainability.
Explain how different model options fit operational needs like speed, scalability, and ease of monitoring.
GenAI Output,

Model Options: Performance vs. Explainability Trade-off
When selecting a model for delinquency prediction, it's crucial to balance predictive performance with the ability to explain why a particular prediction was made. This balance is especially important in financial contexts where understanding the drivers of risk can inform business decisions and regulatory compliance.

Here's a comparison of the two model options discussed earlier:

Logistic Regression

Performance: Logistic Regression typically offers moderate performance. It performs well when there's a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of delinquency. However, it may struggle to capture complex, non-linear interactions or subtle patterns in the data, potentially leading to lower accuracy compared to more sophisticated models.
Explainability: Logistic Regression has high explainability. The coefficients associated with each input feature directly indicate the direction and strength of its relationship with the likelihood of delinquency. For example, a positive coefficient for Missed_Payments means that as missed payments increase, the probability of delinquency increases, and the magnitude of the coefficient quantifies that change. This transparency makes it easy to understand the drivers behind a prediction and communicate them to stakeholders.
Balance: Logistic Regression leans heavily towards explainability over raw performance. It's a "white-box" model where the internal workings are clear.
Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., LightGBM, XGBoost)

Performance: Gradient Boosting Machines generally offer high performance. They are known for achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in many classification tasks, including delinquency prediction. Their ability to model complex non-linear relationships and interactions among features allows them to uncover more subtle patterns that contribute to predicting delinquency.
Explainability: Gradient Boosting Machines have lower explainability compared to Logistic Regression, often considered "black-box" models. While they can provide feature importance scores (indicating which features were most influential overall), it's challenging to explain why a specific individual was predicted as delinquent. Understanding the exact path through hundreds or thousands of decision trees for a single prediction is computationally complex and not intuitively transparent.
Balance: Gradient Boosting Machines prioritize raw performance over explainability. They are powerful predictors but come with a trade-off in terms of direct interpretability of individual predictions. Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can be used to improve their post-hoc explainability, but this adds another layer of complexity.
In summary, if model interpretability is paramount and regulatory requirements demand clear, auditable explanations for every prediction, Logistic Regression might be preferred, albeit with potentially lower predictive power. However, if the primary goal is maximizing prediction accuracy for identifying high-risk individuals, even if it means sacrificing some direct interpretability, Gradient Boosting Machines are the stronger choice.

ACTION - Justification connecting your model choice to Geldium’s goals.

For Geldium, a financial institution, accurately predicting customer delinquency is paramount for minimizing financial losses, optimizing risk management, and ensuring sustainable growth. Our chosen model, Gradient Boosting Machines, directly aligns with these goals by offering superior predictive performance over simpler models. Its ability to effectively capture intricate, non-linear relationships within the customer data, including the subtle interplay between credit score, income, debt, and payment history, allows Geldium to identify high-risk accounts with greater precision. This enhanced accuracy means more effective risk mitigation strategies, more targeted interventions, and ultimately, a healthier loan portfolio, directly contributing to Geldium's financial stability and operational efficiency.

Step 3: Plan how to evaluate model performance
A good model must predict both accurately and fairly. It’s critical to assess the model’s success and ensure it avoids biased or misleading outcomes. Think about how you would:

Identify appropriate evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1 score, AUC, fairness checks).
Assess the model’s accuracy and reliability
Check for bias or unfair treatment across different customer groups
Interpret evaluation metrics and decide when the model needs improvements
Prompts to try:

Suggest a set of metrics to evaluate a financial risk prediction model for fairness, bias, and accuracy.
Provide examples of bias mitigation techniques in predictive modeling for credit risk.”
GenAI - Output,

Bias in predictive modeling for credit risk can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes for certain demographic groups. Mitigating this bias is crucial for ethical AI and regulatory compliance. Here are examples of bias mitigation techniques, typically categorized by the stage of the machine learning pipeline:

1. Pre-processing Techniques (Addressing Bias in the Data Itself)
Resampling:
Oversampling: Increasing the representation of minority (disadvantaged) groups in the training data to ensure the model learns their patterns adequately.
Undersampling: Decreasing the representation of majority (advantaged) groups.
Stratified Sampling: Ensuring that protected attributes (e.g., race, gender) are represented proportionally in training and testing sets.
Reweighting: Assigning different weights to data points in the training set based on their protected attributes and outcomes to balance their influence during model training.
Disparate Impact Remover: Modifying feature values to reduce their correlation with protected attributes while preserving their utility for prediction. This might involve perturbing data points.
Fairness Through Unawareness: Removing protected attributes from the dataset. However, this is often ineffective as other features might act as proxies for the removed attributes.
Data Augmentation: Creating synthetic data points for underrepresented groups to increase their presence and diversity in the dataset.
2. In-processing Techniques (Addressing Bias During Model Training)
Adversarial Debiasing: Training a primary classifier and an adversarial debiasing network simultaneously. The adversarial network tries to predict the protected attribute from the classifier's output, while the classifier tries to minimize its loss and fool the adversary, thus learning a fair representation.
Prejudice Remover (Learning Fair Representations): Modifying the learning algorithm to add a regularization term that penalizes models exhibiting bias towards protected attributes, encouraging the model to learn a fairer representation of the data.
Fairness Constraints (e.g., Equalized Odds, Demographic Parity): Integrating fairness metrics directly into the model's objective function as constraints or regularization terms during training.
Equalized Odds: Ensuring that the true positive rates (and often false positive rates) are equal across different protected groups.
Demographic Parity (Statistical Parity): Aiming for equal positive prediction rates (e.g., loan approval rates) across different protected groups.
Meta-Algorithm for Fair Classification (e.g., Reweighing, Re-sampling in the algorithm): Adjusting the weights of training examples or re-sampling them within the algorithm's iterative process to satisfy specific fairness criteria.
3. Post-processing Techniques (Adjusting Model Predictions After Training)
Reject Option Classification: For predictions falling within a "rejection region" (e.g., near the decision boundary), the model might abstain from making a decision, or a human expert might review these cases to reduce bias.
Equalizing Odds Post-processing: Adjusting the classification threshold for different protected groups after the model has made its predictions, to ensure that fairness metrics (like true positive rates or false positive rates) are equalized across groups.
Calibrated Equalized Odds: A refined version of equalized odds that ensures the predicted probabilities are well-calibrated for each group, improving the fairness of risk assessments.
Threshold Adjustment: Simply changing the decision threshold for loan approval or risk classification based on the protected group to achieve a desired fairness outcome (e.g., ensuring a minimum approval rate for an underserved group).
The choice of technique often depends on the type and severity of bias, the specific fairness definition adopted (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds, individual fairness), the model's complexity, and practical considerations like interpretability and regulatory requirements. Often, a combination of techniques applied at different stages of the ML pipeline yields the best results.

ACTION - Outline your evaluation strategy, identifying key metrics (accuracy, F1 score, AUC, fairness checks) and how you would interpret them.

Evaluation Strategy for Delinquency Prediction Model
Evaluating a delinquency prediction model requires a comprehensive strategy that goes beyond simple accuracy, especially given the imbalanced nature of the target variable. Our strategy will focus on key performance metrics and essential fairness checks to ensure the model is both effective and equitable.

Key Metrics and Interpretation:
Accuracy

Interpretation: Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances (both delinquent and non-delinquent) out of the total number of instances.
Relevance to Delinquency Prediction: While intuitive, accuracy alone can be misleading in imbalanced datasets. A model predicting all accounts as "non-delinquent" in our dataset (84% non-delinquent) would achieve 84% accuracy, but it would fail to identify any actual delinquent customers, making it practically useless. Therefore, accuracy will be considered but not as the primary evaluation metric.
F1 Score

Interpretation: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions (when the model predicts delinquency, how often is it correct?). Recall (also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate) measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances (out of all actual delinquent customers, how many did the model correctly identify?).
Relevance to Delinquency Prediction: The F1 score is crucial for imbalanced datasets because it balances Precision and Recall. For delinquency prediction, we want to minimize both false positives (approving loans to high-risk customers who default) and false negatives (denying loans to good customers or failing to identify existing delinquencies). A high F1 score indicates a good balance between these concerns. We might specifically focus on the F1 score for the positive class (delinquent) due to its minority nature.
Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)

Interpretation: AUC-ROC measures the model's ability to distinguish between the positive (delinquent) and negative (non-delinquent) classes across all possible classification thresholds. A higher AUC (closer to 1) indicates a better ability to discriminate between the two classes. An AUC of 0.5 suggests the model performs no better than random guessing.
Relevance to Delinquency Prediction: AUC is an excellent metric for imbalanced datasets because it is robust to class distribution changes. It provides an overall assessment of the model's discriminative power, indicating how well the model can rank customers by their likelihood of delinquency, which is highly valuable for risk management decisions (e.g., setting credit limits, proactive collections efforts).
Fairness Checks

Interpretation: Fairness checks assess whether the model's predictions or performance metrics are consistent across different demographic or protected groups (e.g., based on age bands, income levels, or other potentially sensitive attributes if available and ethically permissible to analyze for bias). Key fairness metrics include:
Demographic Parity (Statistical Parity): Measures if the positive prediction rate (e.g., predicted delinquency rate) is similar across different groups. If prediction for a group is higher than another, it can indicate bias.
Equalized Odds: Checks if the true positive rates (and sometimes false positive rates) are similar across different groups. This is important to ensure the model's ability to correctly identify delinquents (or non-delinquents) is consistent across groups.
Disparate Impact: Evaluates if a protected group is less likely to receive a favorable outcome (e.g., lower predicted delinquency probability).
Relevance to Delinquency Prediction: Ensuring fairness is critical to avoid discriminatory lending practices. We would analyze these metrics for relevant demographic segments (if available in an ethical and compliant manner) to ensure that the model does not disproportionately flag certain groups as high-risk, or conversely, overlooks risk in others, leading to equitable treatment and regulatory compliance. If bias is detected, mitigation strategies (as previously discussed) would be implemented.
TASK-3
Additional Refinement
Translate your predictive findings into a clear, stakeholder-ready report for Geldium’s Head of Collections. This report will be used to inform the team’s next steps and shape how they apply AI insights in their decision-making.

Step 1: Summary of predictive insights
Use insights from your EDA (Task 1) and the structured predictive model framework (Task 2) to explain:

What key customer segments are at high risk of delinquency
Which variables most strongly influence delinquency
Prompts to try:

Summarize top predictors of customer delinquency based on dataset analysis.
Identify customer segments with the highest delinquency risk and explain why.
GenAI - Output,

Based on the analysis of the cleaned dataset, customer segments with the highest delinquency risk can be identified by focusing on their financial behavior and recent payment history. While some traditional risk indicators showed counter-intuitive average values in the delinquent group (e.g., slightly higher average Credit_Score and slightly lower average Missed_Payments and Loan_Balance), more direct and recent behavioral patterns reveal clearer risk segments.

Here are the customer segments with the highest delinquency risk:

Customers exhibiting a recent increase in 'Late' payment statuses:

Why: The analysis of monthly payment statuses reveals that customers with delinquent accounts tend to have a noticeably higher proportion of 'Late' payments in recent months, specifically in Month_4 and Month_5, compared to non-delinquent customers. This indicates a deteriorating and immediate payment behavior trend, signifying a heightened current risk of delinquency.
Customers with slightly higher Credit Utilization and Debt-to-Income Ratios:

Why: Although the average differences are small, customers with delinquent accounts consistently show slightly higher mean Credit_Utilization and Debt_to_Income_Ratio. These factors indicate that a larger portion of their available credit is being used and a greater share of their income is allocated to debt, suggesting financial strain and a higher likelihood of struggling to meet payment obligations.
While generally considered high-risk factors, the simple mean Credit_Score, Missed_Payments, and Loan_Balance did not directly differentiate delinquent accounts in this dataset as expected, indicating that current delinquency might be driven by more recent behavioral shifts or complex interactions rather than solely by historical static scores or overall missed payment counts.

Action: Create a simple 3-bullet list of "Top 3 Risk Factors" for easy communication.

Here are the top 3 risk factors for delinquency, simplified for easy communication:

Deteriorating Payment History: Customers showing a recent trend of 'Late' or 'Missed' payments are at higher risk.
High Credit Utilization: Individuals using a large portion of their available credit are more likely to become delinquent.
Elevated Debt-to-Income Ratio: A high proportion of income committed to debt indicates financial strain and increased risk of defaulting.
Step 2: Recommendation framework
Choose one key insight and turn it into a SMART business recommendation. Think through:

What action the business could take based on this insight
What action would be most effective, feasible, and aligned with Geldium’s goals?
How you would explain the recommendation to stakeholders
Prompts to try:

Turn this insight — 'High credit utilization increases delinquency' — into a SMART business recommendation.
Draft an executive summary explaining why this recommendation will reduce delinquency and align with business objectives.
Executive Summary: Reducing Delinquency through Advanced Predictive Modeling
This report recommends the adoption of a Gradient Boosting Machine model for predicting customer delinquency, a strategic move designed to significantly reduce financial losses and align with Geldium's core business objectives. Our analysis identified key high-risk indicators, including deteriorating payment histories, high credit utilization, and elevated debt-to-income ratios. By leveraging a Gradient Boosting Machine, Geldium can move beyond reactive measures to proactively identify customers at the highest risk of defaulting. This advanced model's superior predictive accuracy will enable more precise risk assessments, allowing for timely and targeted interventions such such as personalized financial counseling, adjusted credit terms, or proactive collections. This not only minimizes potential loan losses but also optimizes resource allocation, improves customer retention by supporting at-risk clients, and strengthens Geldium's financial stability, ultimately contributing to sustainable growth and a healthier bottom line.

Action: Write one SMART goal and a 1–2 sentence explanation for stakeholders.

Here is a SMART goal and a concise explanation for stakeholders:

SMART Goal: To implement and deploy a Gradient Boosting Machine delinquency prediction model by Q4 2025, aiming to reduce the total value of new delinquent accounts by 10% within six months of deployment, while maintaining equitable outcomes across all customer segments.

Explanation for Stakeholders: This goal focuses on leveraging advanced analytics to significantly improve our ability to identify and mitigate credit risk. By reducing the value of delinquent accounts, we directly enhance profitability and strengthen our financial portfolio.

Step 3: Ethical and responsible AI considerations
Outline a brief ethics section, covering:

Any fairness or bias concerns your model or recommendation might raise
How you would explain the model’s predictions to non-technical stakeholders
How your approach promotes responsible and transparent AI use
Prompts to try:

How would you explain AI model predictions in plain language to non-technical stakeholders?
GenAI -Output,

Here are two fairness risks for a financial risk prediction model and suggested mitigation strategies:

Fairness Risks and Mitigation Strategies
Fairness Risk: Disparate Impact (Unequal Outcome Rates)

Description: This risk occurs when a model's predictions lead to significantly different outcomes (e.g., loan approval rates or predicted delinquency rates) for different demographic or protected groups, even if those groups are equally qualified or have similar underlying risk profiles. For instance, a model might disproportionately flag individuals from a certain racial or age group as high-risk, leading to fewer approvals for that group.
Mitigation Strategy: Re-weighting or Threshold Adjustment:
Re-weighting (Pre-processing): Assign different weights to training examples during model training based on their protected attribute and outcome, to ensure that the model learns to satisfy fairness criteria (e.g., demographic parity) by giving more importance to underrepresented or disadvantaged groups.
Threshold Adjustment (Post-processing): After the model predicts a risk score, adjust the classification threshold (e.g., the score above which a loan is approved) for different protected groups. This ensures that the approval rate or other outcome metrics are more equitable across groups, even if the raw risk scores differ.
Fairness Risk: Disparate Performance (Unequal Predictive Accuracy)

Description: This risk arises when a model's predictive performance (e.g., its accuracy, true positive rate, or false positive rate) varies significantly across different protected groups. For example, a credit risk model might be very accurate for one demographic group but perform poorly (e.g., miss many actual delinquents or incorrectly flag many non-delinquents) for another group, leading to unequal quality of service or disproportionate errors.
Mitigation Strategy: Equalized Odds (In-processing or Post-processing):
Equalized Odds (In-processing): Modify the model's training objective to ensure that the true positive rates (and potentially false positive rates) are equal across different protected groups. This encourages the model to be equally good at identifying positive cases (e.g., actual delinquents) across all groups.
Equalized Odds (Post-processing): After the model has generated predictions, adjust the decision thresholds for each protected group independently to equalize the true positive rates (and optionally false positive rates). This ensures that the model is equally effective at identifying genuine positives and negatives across different groups, providing a more equitable prediction quality.
Action: List two fairness risks and how you would mitigate them.

Fairness Risks and Mitigation Strategies
Here are two common fairness risks in financial risk prediction models and strategies to mitigate them:

Fairness Risk: Disparate Impact (Unequal Outcome Rates)

Description: This risk occurs when the model's predictions lead to significantly different outcomes (e.g., loan approval rates or predicted delinquency rates) for different demographic groups, even if those groups have similar underlying risk profiles. This can inadvertently discriminate against certain protected attributes.
Mitigation Strategy: Re-weighting or Threshold Adjustment.
Re-weighting (Pre-processing): Adjusting the weights of data points in the training set to give more importance to underrepresented or disadvantaged groups, ensuring the model learns more equitably.
Threshold Adjustment (Post-processing): Modifying the decision threshold (e.g., the risk score cut-off for approval) for different groups after the model has made its predictions, to equalize outcome rates across groups.
Fairness Risk: Disparate Performance (Unequal Predictive Accuracy)

Description: This risk arises when the model's predictive performance (e.g., its accuracy, true positive rate, or false positive rate) varies significantly across different protected groups. For instance, the model might be very accurate for one demographic group but perform poorly (e.g., miss many actual delinquents or incorrectly flag many non-delinquents) for another.
Mitigation Strategy: Equalized Odds (In-processing or Post-processing).
Equalized Odds (In-processing): Incorporating fairness constraints directly into the model's training objective to ensure that true positive rates (and potentially false positive rates) are similar across all protected groups.
Equalized Odds (Post-processing): Adjusting the decision thresholds for each group after predictions are made to equalize specific performance metrics (like true positive rates) across groups, ensuring the model is equally effective at identifying genuine positives and negatives for everyone.
